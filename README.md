# Game Instructions:
***Disclaimer***:  whatever is striked is currenly not available but in progress.
- Every player starts with a ~~shuffled team (random positions)~~ on a chess-like board.
- Every player sees his own team weapons and none of the enemies (they all look a like).
- Each turn is limited with a 10 seconds timer
- When a player reaches his turn, he is able to swap between his team members by clicking them and make a move by clicking the arrow indicators shown on each pick.
- When 2 soldiers are facing or next to each other  they are staged into a fight with simple RPS rules. Losing soldier is elminated. If both loses (special cases), they both get eliminated.
- The goal is to find and kill the king
~~- Total game play time is 3 minutes. At the buzzer, the team with the higher survivers will win.~~

## The new epic soldiers:
 
***"Sir-Lasso"*** (currently acts as 'Stone')
<br>Sir Lasso has a 1-time ability to pull an enemy within a range of up to 3 lines and instantly initiate a fight with him (a trick to hook the king very fast). With very very much luck this soldier is a game winner.<br>

***"Shieldon"***
<br>Shieldon has a big shield that will cause its facing opponent to die, no matter what weapon he used. After a battle, Shieldon will be gone up to heaven, after completing his task!<br>

***"Ashes"***
<br>Ashes is a "fake soldier" that will reveal the weapon of its facing opponent ,vanish and die. No matter who is he facing. Ashes will not kill the opponent but only leave him revealed..<br>
