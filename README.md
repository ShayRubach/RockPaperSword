Rock Paper Sword
==

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors remake for the ICQ version (with a twist!).

### Disclaimer 
(c) All graphics were developed by myself with PhotoshopCS6. The project will be soon available for download.

# Game Instructions:
- Every player starts with a shuffled team (random positions) on a chess-like board.
- Every player sees his own team weapons and none of the enemies (they all look a like).
- Each turn is limited with a 20 seconds timer
- When a player reaches his turn, he is able to swap between his team members with the swap key (botton right) and make a move (left, right, down, up) with the arrow controller (bottom  left).
- When 2 soldiers are facing each other, they are staged into a fight with simple RPS rules. Losing soldier is elminated.
- The goal is to find and kill the king
- Total game play time is 3 minutes. At the buzzer, the team with the higher survivers will win.

## The new epic soldiers:
 
***"Sir-Lasso"***
<br>Sir Lasso has a 1-time ability to pull an enemy within a range of up to 3 lines and instantly initiate a fight with him (a trick to hook the king very fast). With very very much luck this soldier is a game winner.<br>

***"Shieldon"***
<br>Shieldon has a big shield that will cause its facing opponent to die, no matter what weapon he used. After a battle, Shieldon will be gone up to heaven, after completing his task!<br>

***"Ashes"***
<br>Ashes a "fake soldier" that will reveal the weapon of its facing opponent and vanish. Ashes will not kill the opponent but only leave him revealed..<br>
